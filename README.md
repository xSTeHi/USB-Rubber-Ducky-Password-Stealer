# USB Rubber Ducky Password Stealer v2
#
Hi guys, this is a simple script, that i've made, to steal all passwords saved on computer(Chrome, Explorer, Mozilla ecc...), using the USB Rubber Ducky !

# INSTRUCTIONS

1)Put the files inside the folder "Password Stealer" into your USB Rubber Ducky 
#
2)(OPTIONAL) Hide the folder or the file WebBrowserPassView.exe to make all undetectable (I prefer to do this for comodity)
#
3)Now remove the USB and put it again into the victim's computer to start the Script (Wait until the script is finished)
#
4)(OPTIONAL) Correct the DELAYS or other things if you want, from the Open Source File
#
# V2 UPDATE
-Now the USB can take every letter (ex: D:\, F:G\ or G:\)
#
-Less Delays for more velocity
#
# THANK YOU
